# Credit-Analysis

Problem

No understanding of customer behavior across multiple banking systems.
Data was spread across several files (account, client, loan, card, trans), making it difficult to:

Identify key customer segments

Understand spending and saving patterns

Support data-driven decisions for credit, marketing, or risk management

**Solution**

This analysis integrated all datasets into one view of each customer and their financial activity.
Key outcomes for stakeholders:

A single, clean dataset connecting clients, accounts, and transactions

Customer insights on age, gender, and spending behavior

Metrics like average monthly transactions and credit card tenure

Clear basis for future models (e.g., customer segmentation or loan risk)

**Next Steps**

Build predictive models to identify high-value or high-risk clients

Create a dashboard for real-time insight into customer trends
